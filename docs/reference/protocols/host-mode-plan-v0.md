# host_mode_plan_v0

`host_mode_plan_v0` is a public-safe host-mode selector for LoopX workflows. It
sits above the shipped [LoopX Turn](loopx-turn-v0.md) and
[runtime connector catalog](../../integrations/runtime-connector-catalog.md): it chooses the
user-facing host mode from intent and advertised host capabilities, then prints
the matching preview command. It is not a launcher, scheduler, permission grant,
validator, or second source of truth.

The problem it solves is operational ambiguity. A user may say "keep working
when I close the visible UI", "let chat create work", or "wake from a timer".
Those are different host modes, but all must preserve the same LoopX invariants:
scoped agent identity, quota guard before work, no-spend quiet checks,
independent validation, durable writeback, and quota spend only after validated
writeback.

## Boundary

The selector returns `mode=dry_run_host_mode_selector`. It must not start a
process, open a session, arm a timer, call a chat gateway, validate a result,
write LoopX state, or spend quota. For any execution path, `loopx_turn_v0`,
TurnEnvelope, registry, quota, todo projection, and run history remain
authoritative.

For headless execution, the selector maps to `loopx turn plan` and then the
existing Turn lifecycle:

```text
LoopX decides -> host adapter executes -> independent validator proves -> LoopX commits
```

That mapping is the key product value: the selector makes mode choice visible
without inventing a parallel runner or a second workflow authority.

## Modes

| mode | connector / contract | good fit | required capability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `visible_tui` | `codex_cli_tui` connector | user wants to watch or steer each turn | `visible_session` |
| `isolated_headless_turn` | `loopx_turn_v0` with `generic-cli` and `isolated-headless` | bounded unattended work through typed host results | `loopx_turn`, `typed_host_adapter`, `independent_validator` |
| `im_gateway` | gateway/webhook connector | chat or another surface should create durable work | `chat_gateway` |
| `shell_service` | shell worker plus LoopX Turn | cron, launchd, service timer, or manual shell wakeup | `service_timer`, `shell`, `loopx_turn`, `typed_host_adapter`, `independent_validator` |
| `hybrid_handoff` | explicit transition contract | one mode should escalate or continue in another | at least two concrete modes ready |

## Intent And Capability Signals

Public-safe `user_intent` signals fail closed when unknown:

- `watch_each_turn` -> `visible_tui`;
- `continue_without_ui` -> `isolated_headless_turn`;
- `intake_from_chat` -> `im_gateway`;
- `timer_keepalive` -> `shell_service`;
- `escalate_between_modes` -> `hybrid_handoff`.

Public-safe `host_capabilities` signals are:

- `visible_session`;
- `loopx_turn`;
- `typed_host_adapter`;
- `independent_validator`;
- `chat_gateway`;
- `service_timer`;
- `shell`.

The first intent selects `selected_mode`. Every mode option still reports
`capability_ready` so an operator can see whether the selected host can actually
run the desired mode.

## Visible Host Identity

A coarse `visible_session` capability cannot distinguish Codex CLI, Claude Code,
or another generic visible host such as OpenCode or Pi. The planner therefore fails
closed for `visible_tui` unless an explicit, catalog-registered `host_identity`
is supplied (`--host-identity`: `codex-cli`, `claude-code`, `generic-cli`, or
the `opencode` / `pi` aliases). With no
identity, the visible option reports `connector_id=null`,
`host_resolution=identity_required`, `turn_mapping.host=null`,
`capability_ready=false`, a blocking reason naming the missing identity, and a
stop-first next step; no Codex CLI default is fabricated. An unregistered
identity similarly yields `connector_id=null` with
`host_resolution=unregistered_host_identity`. The resolution state lives in the
separately typed `host_resolution` field so the `connector_id` field only ever
carries real runtime connector catalog ids.
With an identity, the typed mapping is used: `codex-cli` -> `codex_cli_tui`,
`claude-code` -> `claude_code_loop`, `generic-cli` -> `opencode_goal_loop`
(the OpenCode visible goal loop runs through the generic-cli Turn host;
`--host-identity opencode` is accepted as an alias for the same mapping), and
`pi` -> `pi_goal_loop` (Pi also runs through the generic-cli Turn host while
keeping its own connector identity). Every
emitted connector id must exist in the runtime connector catalog; an identity
with no registered catalog connector fails closed instead of emitting a dynamic
string.

## Readiness And Proofs

Readiness fails closed: a mode only reports `capability_ready=true` when every
capability listed in `required_host_capabilities` is advertised. Because
`shell_service` proves typed host results and independent validation, those
capabilities are part of its requirement; a host with only `service_timer`,
`shell`, and `loopx_turn` is not ready. Each mode option also reports
`missing_host_capabilities`, human-readable `blocking_reasons`, and
`recommended_next_steps` so an operator knows what to fill in before attempting
the mode. When a mode is not ready, the first recommended step is `stop`: the
operator fills the gaps and re-runs the selector before any preview command is
treated as runnable. When `im_gateway` is ready, its steps are intake-first:
create durable work from the chat/webhook surface, confirm LoopX state is safe
to proceed, then choose an execution mode (`isolated_headless_turn` for
unattended runs or `visible_tui` for user gates) without treating the gateway
as an executor.

## Shape

```json
{
  "schema_version": "host_mode_plan_v0",
  "mode": "dry_run_host_mode_selector",
  "agent_model": "peer_v1",
  "goal_id": "loopx-meta",
  "agent_id": "codex-main-control",
  "selected_mode": "isolated_headless_turn",
  "selected_connector_id": "loopx_turn",
  "selected_turn_mapping": {
    "host": "generic-cli",
    "execution_mode": "isolated-headless",
    "scheduler_owner": "outer_controller",
    "plan_command": "loopx turn plan --goal-id loopx-meta --agent-id codex-main-control --host generic-cli --execution-mode isolated-headless --scheduler-owner outer_controller"
  },
  "next_preview_command": "loopx turn plan ...",
  "mode_options": [],
  "identity_contract": {},
  "no_spend_policy": {},
  "turn_contract": {},
  "transitions": [],
  "boundary": {},
  "truth_contract": {}
}
```

Each `mode_options[]` entry includes the connector id, readiness, required
host capabilities, Turn mapping when one exists, scheduler execution context,
quota guard command, and required proofs.

## Functional Points

The selector provides four concrete functions:

1. **Mode choice:** turn user intent into a named host mode instead of forcing
   users and agents to infer visible/headless/gateway/timer behavior manually.
2. **Turn mapping:** for unattended execution, print the exact `loopx turn plan`
   preview that preserves host, execution mode, scheduler owner, agent id, and
   available capabilities.
3. **Readiness surface:** report which advertised capabilities are missing
   before a mode can be trusted.
4. **Safe handoff plan:** name transitions such as visible bootstrap to
   isolated headless Turn, headless user-gate escalation back to visible TUI,
   gateway intake to Turn, and shell timer to visible escalation.

## Acceptance Checks

A fixture or implementation is acceptable when:

1. `schema_version=host_mode_plan_v0` and `mode=dry_run_host_mode_selector`;
2. the five canonical modes are present and intent selects the expected mode;
3. `isolated_headless_turn` maps to `loopx turn plan --host generic-cli
   --execution-mode isolated-headless --scheduler-owner outer_controller`;
4. scoped identity flows into Turn and quota preview commands as `--agent-id`;
5. the no-spend policy covers selector previews, Turn plan previews, quiet
   monitors, cadence-only changes, and final/readiness checks;
6. the boundary says the selector does not execute, write, spend, infer
   production permission, infer credential access, or infer destructive
   authority;
7. no selected mode reports `capability_ready=true` while a capability-backed
   required proof is unavailable (including `shell_service` requiring both
   `typed_host_adapter` and `independent_validator`);
8. visible `host_identity` is required when `visible_tui` is selected, is
   preserved for distinct hosts such as Codex CLI and Claude Code in the
   connector id, Turn mapping, and preview commands, and every emitted connector
   id exists in the runtime connector catalog (unresolved mappings emit
   `connector_id=null` plus a typed `host_resolution` instead of a non-catalog
   value);
9. handoffs preserve the selected agent id and expose target readiness; and
10. unknown intent or host capability values fail closed with suggestions.
